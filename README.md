# Vehical-Tracking
 This project is developed to detect, track, and count vehicles when they cross a predefined virtual line in a video. It uses YOLOv8 for object detection and OpenCV for video processing and visualization.  The system keeps track of each vehicle and increments the count only when the vehicle crosses the line, avoiding duplicate counts.
